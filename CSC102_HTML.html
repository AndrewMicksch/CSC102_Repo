    <h2>There are 4 pillars of programming</h2>

    <h3>Variables</h3>
    <!-- The script tags they specify that we are now coding with javascript - a whole new set of rules apply in JavaScript -->
    <script>
        // this is a single-line javaScript comment
        /* This will be a multiline comment
        
        I chose to skip a line to show this. 
        */

        // 
        var lastName = "Micksch";
    </script>
    <h3>Functions</h3>

    ><script>
        // Functions allow you to organize checks of code. and allow you to easily reuse code.

        // The keyword function lets interpretors know where the code that can be reused is; common practice has use name it with a verb.
        // You should am to use camelCase or snake_case either works but be consistent.

    <h3>Descision Logic (if/else)</h3>
    <script>
        // an if statement will check if the variable exists or if it's true and if it is will run the code head within.
        // in an if code you should only have one if statement, though else if statements can be done any number of times as needed.
        // && requires both conditions to be true
        // || or - requires only one to be true.
