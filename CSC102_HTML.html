    <h3>Variables</h3>
    <!-- The script tags they specify that we are now coding with javascript - a whole new set of rules apply in JavaScript -->
    <script>
        // this is a single-line javaScript comment
        /* This will be a multiline comment
        
        I chose to skip a line to show this. 
        */
        // a variable stores a piece of information
        // Variables should have descriptive names such as firstName

        // let is the best way to create a Javascript variable.
        let firstName = "Andrew";
        
        // 
        var lastName = "Micksch";
    </script>
    <h3>Functions</h3>

    ><script>
        // Functions allow you to organize checks of code. and allow you to easily reuse code.

        // The keyword function lets interpretors know where the code that can be reused is; common practice has use name it with a verb.
        // You should am to use camelCase or snake_case either works but be consistent.
        function addNumbers(){
            let number1 = 5;
            let number2 = 8;

            // Variable to hold the sum
            let sum = number1 + number2;

            // writes sum out to console
            console.log("The sum is:" + sum);

        }

        // For teseting we have this line which calls the addNumbers function.
        addNumbers();
    </script>
    <h3>Descision Logic (if/else)</h3>
    <script>
        // an if statement will check if the variable exists or if it's true and if it is will run the code head within.
        // in an if code you should only have one if statement, though else if statements can be done any number of times as needed.
        // && requires both conditions to be true
        // || or - requires only one to be true.
        if(firstName == "Andrew" && lastName =="Micksch"){
            console.log("Andrew Micksch is Here")
        }
        else if(firstName == "Andrew" || lastName =="Micksch"){
            consolde.log("Andrew is here.")
        }
        // else is what happens if nothing above works.
        else{
            console.log("Andrew is not here")
        }
